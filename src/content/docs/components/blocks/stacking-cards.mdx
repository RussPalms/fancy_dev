## Understanding the component

The component creates a smooth stacking animation by scaling elements based on their index. The first element is the largest, while the last is the smallest, creating a layered effect.  

1. **Scroll Progress**: Tracks the containerâ€™s scroll progress using `scrollYProgress` from `useScroll` to determine the scale of each element.  

2. **Scaling Logic**: Each card's scale is calculated as `1 - (cards.length - index) * 0.03`, starting at 1 (full size) and decreasing down the stack. Adjusting `0.03` modifies the scaling intensity. `rangeScale` ensures lower-index cards shrink earlier in the scroll.  

3. **Smooth Animation**: `useTransform` maps scroll progress to scale values, creating a fluid shrinking effect as the user scrolls.

## Notes

This component uses `Lenis` for smooth scrolling, configured only for the demo container. To apply it to the entire page, refer to the [Lenis documentation](https://github.com/darkroomengineering/lenis) for a simpler setup.

Alternatively, you can remove smooth scrolling as shown in this demo.

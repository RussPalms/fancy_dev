#### Tailwind v4 Migration ðŸŽ‰
We've upgraded to Tailwind v4! This major version brings several important changes:

**Breaking Changes:**
- Configuration is now stored directly in `global.css` instead of `tailwind.config.ts`
- The open-in-v0 feature currently doesn't support CSS variables - these need to be added manually
- CLI installation behavior has changed: CSS variables won't automatically merge with `global.css` when using layers, so you need to add them manually for now. 
- Syntax changes for Tailwind classes and colors (see official [migration guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide))

**Affected Components:**
- Circling Elements
- Animated Gradient With SVG

**Documentation Updates:**
- Contribution guidelines have been updated to reflect v4 changes

For a complete overview of syntax changes and new features, please refer to the official [Tailwind v4 announcement](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4#css-first-configuration).
